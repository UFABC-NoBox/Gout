An ESP8266 data monitoring for your water reservoir.

## BackStory

Some members of the Nobox Robotics team were invited to participate at a Hackaton organized by Leroy Merlin, to launch the so called brico lab on their stores. The theme of this year's event was Water Saving, and our teams made their best to build criative and functional ideas on it.

## The Project

The GOUT project consists of a flux sensor and a system that help and award the user over it's water usage. The sensor on the feeder of the water reservoir, measures the amount of water that enters it, and through a very easy to use and affordable microcontroller with wireless connection (ESP8266), the system can read and display to the user the water he used, and compare it to a previously set goal.

#Warning

This project was developed at a hackaton, the functions implemented here worked flawlessly at the event, but some fuctions like deep-sleep for power saving as planned by the creators are still not implemented, and we encourage you in doing it!
